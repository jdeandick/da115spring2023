# The visualization is useful for exploring the data because it presents a clear and concise overview of the total income by sector and year. The visualization also shows the trend in the total income of each sector over time. By grouping the data by sector, year, and company and summing the annual income, the visualization allows us to identify the sectors that have gained the most in the aftermath of the pandemic's financial upheavals.
# 
# Choosing a horizontal stacked bar chart seems appropriate because it enables a comparison of the total income across different sectors and years while also allowing us to visualize the proportion of the total income that each year contributed to the sector's total. By stacking the bars horizontally, we can compare the total income of different sectors easily. Also, the chart presents the data in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand way.
#Here you can see wealth from the pandemic era at a glance by looking at how much of the stacked bar is composed of pink shades.
